Automating report generation with Python can significantly streamline workflows by reducing manual effort and ensuring timely delivery of reports. This process typically involves collecting data, processing and analyzing it, generating reports in desired formats (such as Excel or PDF), and distributing these reports via email.​

Installation of Required Libraries:

Install the necessary libraries using pip:​

pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl fpdf

Step-by-Step Guide:

    Import Necessary Libraries:

    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import smtplib
    from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
    from email.mime.text import MIMEText
    from email.mime.image import MIMEImage
    from fpdf import FPDF

    Collect and Process Data:

    Load your data into a Pandas DataFrame. This data can come from various sources such as CSV files, databases, or APIs.

    # Example: Load data from a CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

    Generate Visualizations:

    Create plots to visualize the data, which can be included in the report.

    # Example: Plot sales data
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Sales'], marker='o')
    plt.title('Daily Sales Report')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Sales')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.savefig('sales_report.png')

    Create the Report:

    Generate a PDF report that includes both textual and visual data.

    # Initialize PDF
    pdf = FPDF()
    pdf.add_page()
    pdf.set_font("Arial", size=12)

    # Add a title
    pdf.cell(200, 10, txt="Sales Report", ln=True, align='C')

    # Add content
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        pdf.cell(200, 10, txt=f"Date: {row['Date']}, Sales: {row['Sales']}", ln=True)

    # Add the chart
    pdf.image('sales_report.png', x=10, y=pdf.get_y() + 10, w=180)

    # Save the PDF
    pdf.output("Sales_Report.pdf")

    Send the Report via Email:

    Use the smtplib library to send the generated report via email.

    def send_email(report_file):
        sender_email = 'your_email@example.com'
        receiver_email = 'recipient@example.com'
        password = 'your_password'

        # Create the email
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
        msg['From'] = sender_email
        msg['To'] = receiver_email
        msg['Subject'] = 'Automated Sales Report'

        # Attach the body
        body = 'Hello, please find attached the daily sales report.'
        msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

        # Attach the report
        with open(report_file, 'rb') as file:
            report_attachment = MIMEText(file.read(), 'base64', 'utf-8')
            report_attachment.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename=report_file)
            msg.attach(report_attachment)

        # Send the email
        with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587) as server:
            server.starttls()
            server.login(sender_email, password)
            server.send_message(msg)
            print("Email sent successfully!")

    # Call the function to send the email
    send_email('Sales_Report.pdf')

Explanation:

    Data Collection: Data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.​

    Data Visualization: A line plot is generated to visualize daily sales trends and saved as an image.​
